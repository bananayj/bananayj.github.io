		<h2> "Selfies" </h2>

			<ul>

			</ul>

		
			<p1> The first selfie was about how I was raised by my Grandmother instead of my parents. So a lot of my morals and the way I take life on, is similar to my Grandmother tackles life. That is why I overlapped my partially transparent baby photo with her partially trasnparent photo. <br>
				The second selfie is about a birth mark I have on my leg. It is a faded brown colour and is the size of a pinky nail. It is a birth mark of a giraffe. So I did a sillhouette of a giraffe using giraffe patterns on Adobe Illustrator.</p1>

			<p3> My gift is a business card design for my Father who has recently quit his job as a chef to become a HVAC maintenance man. He does not speak English that well so I made one of the sides of the business card in English and the other in Chinese. </p3>
