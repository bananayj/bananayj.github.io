		<h2> "Selfies: Anything But My Face" </h2>

			<ul>

				<li><a href="selfie_project_link.html">Selfie 1 and 2</a></li>
			
			</ul>

		
			<p> The first selfie was about how I was raised by my Grandmother instead of my parents. So a lot of my morals and the way I take life on, is similar to my Grandmother tackles life. That is why I overlapped my partially transparent baby photo with her partially trasnparent photo. <br>
				The second selfie is about a birth mark I have on my leg. It is a faded brown colour and is the size of a pinky nail. It is a birth mark of a giraffe. So I did a sillhouette of a giraffe using giraffe patterns on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

			<p> My gift is a business card design for my Father who has recently quit his job as a chef to become a HVAC maintenance man. He does not speak English that well so I made one of the sides of the business card in English and the other in Chinese. </p>

				<li><a href="master_project_link.html">Become The Master Images</a></li>

			<p> For this project we were supposed to teach a skill to someone, I made an image teaching people how to tie a tie. </p>

				<h2> "Monograph: Yantra" </h2>

				<li><a href="yantra_pics.html">Monograph Images</a></li>

			<p> For my monograph project, I chose to research about yantra tattoos from Thailand because of my interest in tattoos. <br>
				For the project, I made a small booklet which explained the history of yantra tattoos and also has yantra symbols. <br> There is also a box with henna tools so that readers could create their own yantra tattoos.

				<h2> "Love Letter: Forbidden Love"" </h2>

				<li><a href="http://prezi.com/qdeb--sbsfd-/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy">Prezi Link</a></li>

			<p> For my love letter I did a presentation on tattoos. Tattoos to me is art on someone's body, although where I come from tattoos have a bad rep, I think they are beautiful art forms.
